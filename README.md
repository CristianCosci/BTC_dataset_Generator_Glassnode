# BTC Dataset Generator Glassnode â‚¿

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that uses the [Glassnode](https://glassnode.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwlPWgBhDHARIsAH2xdNdl88ENmYxIJRH_ukksfS7c0wCRUpT78WIiUVRFjVapGFnK9JfOC5IaAnb7EALw_wcB) API to extract data related to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and create a dataset.

## **Usage**
To use the Jupyter Notebook contained in this repository, you need to have a valid account on Glassnode and know your API access credentials by directly setting the `API_KEY` variable at the beginning of the script. Otherwise you can upload it to a `.txt` file saved to your Google Drive account.

Make sure you check all the paths and change them for your personal case (make sure you also specify the correct path to the `. txt` file uploaded to this repository).

The `.txt` files contained in this repository are needed by the notebook to call the specific API for each feature. You can edit it yourself, but make sure you enter the correct path from where to upload it to your notebook.

The `.txt` file contains all the features available on Glassnode on the day the files were uploaded.

If you have any problems, open a **Problem** or publish a post on **Discussion**.
